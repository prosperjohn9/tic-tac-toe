## Algorithm for the Tic Tac Toe Game

    1. Game Structure and Modules:
        a.) Create a gameBoard Module that stores the game state, including the game board array and methods to manipulate it.
        b.) Create a player factory function that generate player objects.
        c.) Create a displayController module that handles rendering the game board and user interface/
        d.) Create a gameFlow module that controls the flow of the game, including starting/restarting the game and checking the winner.

    2. HTML Setup:
        a.) Setup an HTML structure for the game board, buttons, input fields and display elements to interact with the game.

    3. Render Game Board:
        a.) Use the displayController module to render the initial game board on the HTML page.
        b.) Bind click event listeners to the game board cells to allow players to make their moves.

    4. Player Moves:
        a.) Implement logic to handle player moves when a cell is clicked on the game board.
        b.) Update the game board array in the gameBoard module with the player's mark.
        c.) Render the updated game board using the displayController module.

    5. Prevent Invalid Moves:
        a.) Check if the selected cell is already occupied before allowing the players to make a move.
        b.) Display an error message or prevent the move if the cell is already taken.

    6. Check for Game Over: 
        a.) Implement logic check for a winning condition (3-in-a-row) or a tie condition on the game board array.
        b.) Display a congratulatory message to the winning player or a message for a tie game.

    7. Player vs. AI:
        a.) Create an AI opponent that can make random legal moves.
        b.) Add levels to the AI by implementing the Minimax Algorithm to create an unbeatable AI.
        c.) Allow players to choose the AI level when starting the game.

    8. Enhancements: 
        a.) Allow players to input their names.
        b.) Include a start/restart button to initialize the game.
        c.) Improve the user interface and display elements for a better user experience.
